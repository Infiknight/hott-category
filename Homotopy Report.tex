We defined precategory, category, isomorphic arrows in a category, the type a $\cong$ b of all isomorphisms from a to b, functor, full, faithful, natural transformation, and left and right adjoints. As well as composition of functors, composition of natural transformations, and the two common ways to compose a functor with a natural transformation. We proved Lemma 9.1.3 which says that for any arrow f, the type is-isomorphism(f) is an h-prop, and that for any objects a and b, a $\cong$ b is an h-set. Lemma 9.1.4 (idtoiso), if A is a precategory and a, b : A then (a = b) $\rightarrow$ (a $\cong$ b). Lemma 9.1.8, in a category, the type of objects is a 1-type. And Lemma 9.1.9, for p : a = a' and q : b = b' and f : $hom_A(a, b)$, we have $(p, q)_*(f)$ = idtoiso$(q)$ $\circ$ $f$ $\circ$ idtoiso$(p)^{-1}$ , idtoiso$(p^{-1})$ = (idtoiso$(p))^{-1}$, idtoiso$(p$ $\bullet$ $q)$ = idtoiso$(q)$ $\circ$ idtoiso$(p)$, and isotoid$(f$ $\circ$ $e)$ = isotoid$(e)$ $\bullet$ isotoid$(f)$.
And that the type of all functions between two h-sets is an h-set. We defined the precategory Set which has h-sets as objects and functions between them as arrows; the precategory Functor-Precategory which has the functors between two given precategories as objects and natural transformations between the functors as arrows; the opposite precategory and the product of two precategories. As well as the functor $Hom_A : A^{op} \times A \rightarrow Set$, which maps a pair of objects (a, b) to $hom_A(a, b)$ and maps a pair of arrows $(f , f') : Hom_{A^{op} \times A} ((a, b), (a', b'))$ to the function which maps g in $hom_A(a, b)$ to $f' \circ g \circ f$.
